# Advent of Code!

My repository of solutions for [Advent of Code](https://wwww.adventofcode.com) from over the years.

Advent of Code is an "Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other."

I participate in advent of code yearly along side some programmers in my family. These problems are well designed, and make for great algorithms and discussions.
